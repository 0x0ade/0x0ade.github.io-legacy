    <p>Back in Juny, when Google I/O 2014 happened, I was fascinated by the idea of a simple, minimalistic design, made out of some kind of material. Well, it's the Material design guidelines. But Google didn't just show off Android L and Material, but also some kind of theme, design, for the web - Material for the web. Unfortunately since then, I forgot the name of the project, until&hellip;</p>
<h3>Polymer.</h3>
<p>It was just recently (selfnote: add publish dates; around 2014-09-25) when I noticed a tweet from the Polymer Twitter account on my timeline. As I didn't follow Polymer, I was lucky that someone else was retweeting their tweet. Recognizing their logo, I went to their homepage just to find the reference implementation of the Material guidelines for the web platform. I noticed it was lacking animations in some parts, but was more mature than my little test theme I've created by modifying Matt Graham's &ldquo;Midnight&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As I already have twice changed the design of my website, I kind of hate myself for doing it a third time. But for reference, a button (which you may not find often on my website) looks like following as of the time you are viewing this page: <a class="button" href="javascript:;">I'm a button!</a></p>
<p>As I like to do stuff by myself to learn stuff, I guess it's time to adapt my design to Polymer. I'm not going to replace it with Polymer yet. <s>Maybe I won't ever replace my design with Polymer</s>. But I like that there's another, greater, better, implementation of the Material design out there.</p>
<p>EDIT #1: It's great.</p>
<p>I had some smaller problems with implementing the toolbar being overlapped by the posts, so I went with a header area like the old one. Also, the sidebar has been replaced by a menu button.</p>
<p>I still need to rework some of the on-hover effects as the cursor is the &ldquo;digital hand&rdquo;, which means you should be able to pick up or focus on the material with the &ldquo;digital hand&rdquo; by hovering and write to it with the &ldquo;ink&rdquo; by clicking. Latter is specified by the Material guidelines, but not the focus.</p>
<p>EDIT #2: It's still buggy.</p>
<p>As it still is in a testing phase, it was obvious that it's not perfect. Most of the caused problems were mobile mode problems. Also, creating my own Material implementation gives me more freedom.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll retry as soon as it's stable, not just mature.</p>
