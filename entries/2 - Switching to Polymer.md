Back in Juny, when Google I/O 2014 happened, I was fascinated by the idea of a simple, minimalistic design, made out of some kind of material. Well, it's the Material design guidelines. But Google didn't just show off Android L and Material, but also some kind of theme, design, for the web - Material for the web. Unfortunately since then, I forgot the name of the project, until...  

###Polymer.

It was just recently (selfnote: add publish dates; around 2014-09-25) when I noticed a tweet from the Polymer Twitter account on my timeline. As I didn't follow Polymer, I was lucky that someone else was retweeting their tweet. Recognizing their logo, I went to their homepage just to find the reference implementation of the Material guidelines for the web platform. I noticed it was lacking animations in some parts, but was more mature than my little test theme I've created by modifying Matt Graham's "Midnight".  

As I already have twice changed the design of my website, I kind of hate myself for doing it a third time. But for reference, a button (which you may not find often on my website) looks like following as of the time you are viewing this page: <a class="button" href="javascript:;">I'm a button!</a>  

As I like to do stuff by myself to learn stuff, I guess it's time to adapt my design to Polymer. I'm not going to replace it with Polymer yet. Maybe I won't ever replace my design with Polymer. But I like that there's another, greater, better, implementation of the Material design out there.
