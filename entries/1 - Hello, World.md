Hello, World! My name is Maik Macho, but you may find me in the internet as AngelDE98. What you are seeing here is my new - actually my first - website. Don't expect much to find here.  

I guess I won't post much here, except it's not fitting anywhere else and / or it's some longer text or it's the release of any noteworthy software I've created. In case you want to be informed anyway, there's the RSS feed button. If you really want to follow me, Twitter is the best method.

As you may have or have not noticed, this page is hosted on GitHub Pages but not using Jekyll. It was created using [JsonBlog](https://github.com/AngelDE98/jsonblog), a website building tool I wrote for this website and the upcoming [Fourbytes Website](http://fourbytes-team.github.io).  

The theme is based off Midnight by Matt Graham but heavily modified by me as I've tried to make it fit the Google Material design guidelines: A custom wallpaper, the Roboto font, a sidebar hidden by default and accessible with a menu button, cards, animations, and some more tweaks. It also is my first big theme modification, thus as such, it contains some CSS hacks for the PNG shadows and IE incompatibilities.

Feel free to comment below in case you have got any suggestions for this blog / website.
